# Orchestrator Service

The orchestrator service encapsulates request routing and scoring for miners. 
Currently, it is under development to better integrate with the Dippy app. As such, at this time only snippets are provided to shed light on the routing mechanism. This section will be fully released in the near future.

This is very old code that has been superseded by https://github.com/impel-intelligence/dippy-studio-bittensor-orchestrator
